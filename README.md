# element-library

> IMPORTANT: The elements are work in progress and subject to major (& breaking) changes until the 1.0 release. Until then, we would encourage everyone to use pinned versions for any package and not rely on semantic versioning.

A set of web components built with `@webtides/element-js`

## Introduction

`@webtides/element-library` provides a set of pre-built custom elements based on `@webtides/element-js` with performance and accessibility in mind. They provide a starting point for rapidly building UIs without having to re-implement the same elements over and over again.

## Demo

See our [live Storybook](https://webtides.github.io/element-library) to preview examples of all our elements.

## Elements

Elements are divided into 3 categories.
